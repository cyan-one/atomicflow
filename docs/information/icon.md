# Overview

Icons are deceptively difficult. Usually, they are loaded from a separate source (sometimes even a separate origin), and can be one of the last elements to appear on a page. When they do finally load, they often cause the interface to resize.

The icon element has two purposes: to give all icons a set width and height (`1em` by `1em` by default) so that the page doesn't resize when they load, and to ensure that the icon is the correct color (by setting the `color` and `fill` properties).

If you're looking for a nice way to display icons in your content, consider using the icon element in conjunction with a [shield](/information/shield/).

# Considerations

**Margins** --- Icons have no margins by default. (This will make your life easier.) Just remember to set them yourself!

**Vertical alignment** -- By default, icons are vertically aligned with the middle of the text. If the `font-size` of the surrounding text is not the same as the icon, you may need to tweak things.

# Variants

Icons inherit their color from their context using the `--color-content` variable.

{% capture example %}
{% for tone in site.tones %}
<span class="icon m-2 ~{{tone}} !low">
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="12" height="13">
        <g stroke-width="2" stroke="currentColor" fill="none">
            <path d="M11.29 11.71l-4-4" />
            <circle cx="5" cy="5" r="4" />
        </g>
    </svg>
</span>
